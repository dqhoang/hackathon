# hackathon

This is mostly code from the Django tutorial. 

Next up:
  * Add bar charts of the votes in D3
  * Find a templating system so i'm not copying html from one page to another
  
For those that are wondering, yes i'm THAT lazy. Manage.bat is just the python call to manage.py.
  You still need to pass it the manage.py params ( such as runserver )
    * Manage.bat runserver
  
This is built in:
  * Python 3.5
  * Djang 1.8.5
  * Windows
